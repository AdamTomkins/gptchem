The data appears to lie in a lower-dimensional subspace of the space in which it is expressed. This has resulted in a singular data covariance matrix, which cannot be treated using the algorithms implemented in `gaussian_kde`. Consider performing principle component analysis / dimensionality reduction and using `gaussian_kde` with the transformed data.
